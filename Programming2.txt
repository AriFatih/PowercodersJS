TipCalculator
    Initialize billAmount to 0
    Initialize tip to 0
    Initialize tipRate to 0
    Initialize total to 0

    Prompt for billAmount with "What is the bill amount?"
    Prompt for tipRate with "What is the tip rate?"

    convert billAmount to a number
    convert tipRate to a number

    tip = billAmount * (tipRate / 100)
    round tip up to nearest 5 rappen  
    total = billAmount + tip

    Display "Tip : CHF" + tip
    Display "Total : CHF" + total

1) SAY HELLO
Create a program that prompts for your name and prints a greeting using your name.


SayHello
	Initialize name to ""

	Promt for the name "Please write your name"

	Display " Hello " + name

End

2) Number Of Characters
Create a program that prompts for an input string and displays output that shows the input string and the number of characters the string contains.

NumberOfChars
Initialize input to ""
Initialize numberOfChars to 0

Prompt for the input string "Please write your input to know its number of characters"


Calculate the number of characters

Display "Your Input consists of" +numberOfChars +" characters "


End


3) Guessing a Number

I am thinking of an integer between 1 and 100. Your task is to find this number by asking me questions of the form "Is your number higher, 
lower or equal to x" for different numbers x.

Describe input and output
List the steps of an algorithm that solves the guessing problem
How many steps do you need?
Can you think of a mathematical formula your algorithm is based on?

GuessingNumber

Inputs:
Answer to our question: Higher, lower or equal (String)
Output: Questions and "Your number is "+ GuessedNumber (String)

INSTANTIATE GuessedNumber TO 0
INSTANTIATE Answer TO ""

1) Create a random number between 1-100 and assigned TO (GuessedNumber)
2) Ask the user if that random number is higher, lower or equal to the User's number
3) If the answer is higher: Create a random number between the GuessedNumber and 100 : Assign the new number to GuessedNumber
	Go to the Second Step
4) Else If the answer is lower:Create a random number between the GuessedNumber and 0 : Assign the new number to GuessedNumber
	Go to the Second Step
5) Else If the answer is Equal: Give back "Your number is" + GuessedNumber
