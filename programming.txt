EXERCISE1

Allow the user to input digits, afterwards sort and print them in numerical order.

Pseudocode:
1) Take the all input digits from the user
2) After taking them select the first digit as the digit to compare
3) Compare the digit with the others,if one of them is smaller than the digit our new digit is that new smaller one
4) If the comparison is finished for all the digits: the digit is the smaller digit if the serie
5) For the remaining digits 2-3 and 4th steps are repeated

EXERCISE2
Find the number of the year for the given date. For example, january 1st would be 1, and december 31st is 365.

Pseudocode:
1) Take the date(month+day) from the user
2) Look at the month, if it is January : number= 0*31+day
3) Look at the month, if it is February : number= 1*31+day
4) Look at the month, if it is March : number= 1*31+1*28+ day (We assume year is 365 day, we can also control that)
5) Look at the month, if it is April : number= 2*31+1*28+ day
6) Look at the month, if it is May : number= 2*31+1*28+1*30+ day
7) Look at the month, if it is June : number= 3*31+1*28+1*30+ day
8) Look at the month, if it is July : number= 3*31+1*28+2*30+ day
9) Look at the month, if it is August : number= 4*31+1*28+2*30+ day
10) Look at the month, if it is September : number= 5*31+1*28+2*30+ day
11) Look at the month, if it is October : number= 5*31+1*28+3*30+ day
12) Look at the month, if it is November : number= 6*31+1*28+3*30+ day
13) Look at the month, if it is December : number= 6*31+1*28+4*30+ day

EXERCISE3
Create a random password generator. The password has to have a length of at least 8 characters, at least 1 digit and 1 special char (_ or -).

Pseudocode:
1) Select 8 digit place to write our password
2) For first digit there are 10+2=12 options: select one of them
3) REpeat the second step for the other 7 digits

EXERCISE4
Validate a telephone number, as if written on an input form. Telephone numbers can be written as ten digits, 
or with dashes, spaces, or dots between the three segments, or with the area code parenthesized; 
both the area code and any white space between segments are optional.

Pseudocode:
1) Take the telephone number from user:0779994397
2) Control all the digits number is 10
3) If digit number is 10 then control if they are numbers, 
4) If they are numbers result is true, if not result=false
5) If digit number is more than 10 control the digit between segments
6) If thse segments are dashes, spacaes or dots result=true, if not result=false
